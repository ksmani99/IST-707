# HW3 - we are going to explore the bank data, available on the LMS, and an accompanying description of the attributes and their values. The dataset contains attributes on each person's demographics and banking information in order to determine they will want to obtain the new PEP (Personal Equity Plan).

#goal is to perform Association Rule discovery on the dataset using Weka.
#install.packages("RWeka")

## Loading the data set, exploring, and cleaning . And before we start doing association rules mining, we need to load the required data set - `bankdata_csv_all.csv` -, explore it, and clean it.


dat <- read.csv('C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/MSDatascience/IST707/Week3/bankdata_csv_all.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Check the structure, summary, and head of the data set. 
str(dat)
summary(dat)
head(dat)

#Now that we have checked the data set, we'll start cleaning it. 
#We need to eliminate the `id` variable and convert the numeric fields into ordinal variables. 

# Drop the id column
datClean <- dat[, 2:12]

# Convert numeric variable to ordinal. 
for(i in 1:ncol(datClean)){
  if(class(datClean[[i]]) != 'factor'){
    datClean[[i]] <- as.factor(datClean[[i]])
  }
}


#With the data converted, we can start exploring different rules. 

#*************Association Rules Mining*************************

# We set the support and confidence parameters to 0.35 and 0.60, respectively, to obtain 42 sets of rules. 
rules <- apriori(datClean, parameter = list(supp = .25, conf = .70))

summary(rules)

# We find that the minimum lift is 0.98, while the maximum lift is 1.13, giving us a good set of robust rules, while also throwing in the mix some independent associations. 
# Check  the top 10 rules that we have found. 
options(digits = 3)
rules <- sort(rules, decreasing = TRUE, by = 'lift')
inspect(rules[1:10])

# The top rule has lift of 1.24, showing that if you don't have a mortgage nor pep, chances are you're likely married. Interesting as the rule might give the idea that these are causes of people getting married.

## PEP analysis - Explore what rules can explain whether a customer takes a PEP or not. 

datTransactions <- as(datClean, 'transactions')

pepRules <- apriori(datTransactions, parameter = list(maxlen = 4), 
                    appearance = list(rhs = c("pep=YES", "pep=NO")))
inspect(pepRules)

#This is very interesting. If we focus solely on the bottom four rules, we find that not only these have `pep=NO` on the RHS but, on the LHS, they all share the same rule: No children. This can mean that married couples with no children have less expenses, therefore they don't need a personal equity plan. 
#Similarly, these couples don't have mortgages, cars, or savings accounts. 

plot(pepRules[7:10], method = 'graph')


#These four rules are very interesting and, given that they all have high lift and confidence levels above 0.80, I would personally advise not to offer Personal Equity Plans to couples who don't have children. 

plot(pepRules[1:6], method = 'graph')

#However, couple who do have children are likelier to take out a PEP, making them a prime target to offer this product. But, I would also add that, among parents, those who currently have an account plus a savings account, are far more likely to have a PEP than those who don't. 
#This is clear because, among the set of rules for people who do have a PEP, those who have childern, savings accounts, and other accounts have a confidence of 0.86 and the highest lift out of all the rules with 1.89; meaning that having a PEP is dependent on having the prior three things. 

inspect(sort(pepRules[6:10], decreasing = TRUE, by = 'lift'))
